## Copenhagen

### Activities

### Attractions

#### Tivoli

The world's longest running theme park. It's awesome and super fun. Highly recommended for a night our with colleagues, or a day with the kids.

### Cafes and Restaurants

#### Social Brew

A very Melbourne vibes cafe that roast their own coffee and have delicious meals! Not too expensive either, and lots of options for those with dietary requirements.

#### Ordering online

The app to order food online in Copenhagen is called Wolt.

### Shopping

If you're looking for groceries, then Super Brugen is a great stop. Flying Tiger and Normal will have some snacks you can buy, otherwise there is 7 Eleven and Netto for quick stops.

### Transport

### Cycling

Copenhagen is the bike city of the world. You can get around almost anywhere with a bike. There are plenty around the streets to rent (including electric and non-electric bikes). Some hotels also do bike rental.

#### Ubers and taxis

Uber is non-existent in Denmark, so you'll need to order a taxi. The easiest way to do this is get your hotel to order one, or flag down a taxi.

#### Trains

Copenhagen Central Station is the perfect way to get around. You can even jump on a short 45 minute train ride to Sweden! You can purchase a ticket at the station (train doesn't allow for credit card tap on).

#### Walking

Great city for walking. Everything is very walker friendly. Make sure you take good shoes, and remember cars will give way to you, but not bikes!
