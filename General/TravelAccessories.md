# Best items you need when you travel

Here are a bunch of travel items you might like to consider when you head out on your journey. They are listed in alphabetical order.

## Cadence

If you are travelling a lot, then [Cadenance leak proof containers](https://keepyourcadence.com/) are a must add to your travel luggage. They are light, don't leak, come in lots of colours, and can store all your pills, creams, liquids, and even small jewellery.

## July

The best luggage going around is [July](https://july.com/au/). They have suitcases, roller cases, luggage covers, passport wallets, and more. Super high quality, great colours, good warranty, and great designs.

## MOGICS Bagel, Super Bagel, and Donut

The [Bagel, Super Bagel, and Donut](https://www.mogics.com/3824-2) are universal power adaptors and power strip. There's an adjustable cord, dual USB ports, fast charge support, and safety fuse. There's the AC plug and includes USB C. It is much smaller than an adapter and power strip, and a lot lighter.
