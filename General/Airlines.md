# Airlines

Here's a list of airlines and our tips on each one. They are listed in alphabetical order.

## Cathay Pacific

Great service and part of the One World Alliance. They offer premium economy cabins as well as other classes. They mainly operate around the Asia region (Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand etc.)

## Emirates

Really good service and great in flight experiences. You'll need to purchase an extra legroom seat if this is something you want. They don't offer free legroom seats for status. Premium cabins usually sell out well in advance. If you want to purchase an Emirates ticket and you want the Qantas FF, then make sure you purchase the flight as a QF8XXX flight. If you get an EK flight, you'll receive the points for the flight, but not the status.

## Qantas

Part of the One World Alliance. Has all travel classes, however some routes don't have Premium Economy or First Class. You'll need to purchase an extra legroom seat if this is something you want. They don't offer free legroom seats for status.

## Qatar

Part of the One World Alliance, and also a Virign Australia partner. Good airline, however the do not operate a Premium Economy service. Their business class is fantastic and you even receive PJs.

## Singapore Airlines

Part of the Star Alliance network. They have good on board service and offer a few cabins. Note that on Melbourne to Singapore flights there is now only one meal provided and a snack rather than two meals.

## Virgin Australia

Has some good Star Alliance and other international partners, but their international network is very scarce.
